## Umcompress & Compress
-------------------------

### 7zip

#### Unzip zip file

```shell
7z.exe e *.zip
```

#### List files in archive

```shell
7z.exe l -r filename.zip
```

### For tar.gz

To unpack a tar.gz file, you can use the **tar** command from the shell. Here's an example:

```shell
tar -xzf rebol.tar.gz
```

The result will be a new directory containing the files.

(Also, on many systems, when you download the tar.gz from a web browser, an unpacker will open, and you can just use that.)

### For just .gz (.gzip)

In some cases the file is just a gzip format, not tar. Then you can use:

```shell
gunzip rebol.gz
```

In order to execute it, you will need to add execute permissions to the file:

```shell
chmod +x rebol
```
