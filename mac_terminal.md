# Mac Terminal

## `root` user



In macOS the root user is DISABLED by default. Also note, macOS is not Linux! You should really use sudo as @Philippe suggested.

In a Terminal window:

```bash
sudo su -
```

**Result**

```bash
$ sudo su -  
 Password:  
 macmini8:~ root# passwd  
 Changing password for root.  
 New password:  
 Retype new password:  
```
