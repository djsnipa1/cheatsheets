# Most Useful Command Line Tools: 50 Cool Tools to Improve Your Workflow, Boost Productivity, and More

__ Alexandra Altvater__ May 10, 2017[__ Developer Tips, Tricks & Resources][0]

Developers and those with engineering responsibilities are fond of calling terminal their home. Anyone with a Unix system has to frequently interact with the Terminal in one way or the other. And customization has always been a big part of how much the Terminal can be used to improve productivity, create unique experiences, and manage the system to improve the workflow. At Stackify, we're always up for quirky and innovative tools that help us become more productive developers. So no matter how you prefer to work, taking frequent breaks, relying on a lengthy task list, GTD methodology, with your favorite music playing in the background, you can make all of that and more happen from right within the Terminal with command line tools.

Command line tools are scripts, programs, and libraries that have been created with a unique purpose, typically to solve a problem that the creator of that particular tool had himself. Because of that, we have divided this roundup of the best command line tools to include different categories, like Web Development, Utilities, Productivity, and others. Beyond being categorized, note that the following 50 command line tools are listed in no particular order --- they're not ranked or rated, but are numbered simply to make a list easier to navigate.

These are all open-source projects, so everything is free to download, and you can become a contributor to any of the projects through GitHub, where most of these tools have been hosted. To check out command line tools in a particular category, click on a link below:
